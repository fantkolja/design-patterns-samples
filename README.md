# Samples for a Design Patterns course

## C# samples

All C# samples are located in the separate [folder](./csharp).

To run the samples in C#:
- install Dotnet [CLI v. 7.0.](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download);
- chage to `/csharp` subfolder;
- install dependencies;
- run `dotnet run`.

To launch a specific module, you can update [the first line](./csharp/Program.cs#L1) of the root Program.cs file.
The [other lines](./csharp/Program.cs#L2-L5) of the root Program.cs file are needed to hold the process before exiting.
